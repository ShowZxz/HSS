Important !
Submitting a score can now be done in game using a button/key of your choice or f3 (vpinmame reset).
Best way to do that is after a complete game played.
When you do it in the middle of a game you can get pinball missing message starting a new game.
If you get a lot of missing pinball messages even after completed games revert to the old method (exiting a game)

This will check if the initials are different from the standard initials that are in for that game to prevent mistakes
